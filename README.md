# Mt.Gox Leak & Bitcoin Stories
The new project under way and (I hope) there is a lot of fresh fun :-)

Many Bitcoin players dwelled at Mt.Gox before shifted to Coinbase and other exchange platforms, and there was a leak of Mt.Gox's transaction data during its bankruptcy process, which constructs the raw material for this project. My plan is to turn data into a process of documentation: Not that kind of documentation you see at coding language/library sites, but a documentation mixed with human and machine dialects.

The project was initially inspired by <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world?language=en">Kevin Slavin's talk</a> on algorithm at TED.
